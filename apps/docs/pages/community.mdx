## Hasura

The workhorse that powers the Starter Kit. The DSL really compiles down to Hasura metadata.

## Thanks

The Starter Kit uses several packages. Thanks!
- The [hasura-auth authentication package](https://github.com/nullxone/hasura-auth) is based on the [hasura-auth package by nhost](https://github.com/nhost/hasura-auth)
- These docs are modified from [supabase docs](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/tree/master/apps/docs)
